# Clock App

This repository contains an implementation of an interactive clock animation.

This clock was written in Java, using a rudimentary graphics engine which was created from scratch.

# User Guide

## Setting the Time
- Click and drag any of the main Clock Hands to set the time to suit.

## Use of Stopclock
- Press spacebar to start, stop, then reset the Stopclock.
- While Stopclock is running, press 'L' to log laptime (up to x4 laptimes displayed in bottom left corner).
- Resetting the Stopclock clears the logged times and resets the hands.

## Use of World Clock
- Use UP or DOWN arrow keys to cycle through the world times; UP = +, DOWN = -.
- City names will also change accordingly showing the time in each city.

# Issues
- Clock can occasionally freeze on startup or when 'over-clicking' keys or buttons in the canvas.
- Stopclock times might stop logging when pressing 'L'.

Terminating and restarting the program should solve these issues.
